## Introduction

The SIMPLO CMS has many configuration options, which offers you a lot of flexibility and another functionalities. 
As a developer, you can set them using [environment configuration](https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/configuration#environment-configuration) 
with your `.env` file, define new configuration or rewrite default configuration from `config` directory in your theme project. 
Except of these possibilities, you can easily make some changes directly in SIMPLO CMS administration panel, what is very 
comfortable, effective and easy.
