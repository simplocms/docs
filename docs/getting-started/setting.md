The SimploCMS has many configuration options, which offers you a lot of flexibility and another functionality. 
As a developer, you can set them in your `.env` file or define new configuration or rewrite default configuration from 
`config` directory in your theme project, but except of these possibilities, you can easily make some changes directly in SimploCMS 
administration panel what is very comfortable, effective and easy.
