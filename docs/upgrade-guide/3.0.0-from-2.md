# Upgrade

Before you start, make sure you have new version fetched. Update all dependencies with `composer install` and `npm i` commands.

## Paradigm shift

New version is more than less about refactoring old code by rewriting many components and services to use (and to be used) features of **Dependency Injection**, which brings little bit of enlightenment into this project.

Since it's not an easy job to refactor all the code at once, starting with small (but important) pieces there is a goal to complete this refactoring until version 4.0.

From now on, all the new code should follow this paradigm and meet bit higher standards.

## New themes

New theming system brings bigger possibilities and more responsibility on the side of a theme. Another goal was to improve code readability, sustainability and extensibility.

To understand how new themes in new version work, read the "Themes" category of documentation.
