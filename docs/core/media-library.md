## Introduction

Media Library provides a common interface for working with files, so it's not needed to implement a file upload, making
thumbnails of images, etc.

## How To Use

You can find Media Library in the admin panel menu. When you visit this page, then it's possible to create a directory,
upload a file, show a detail of the file, rename a file, etc. All operations, what you will do there, will be commonly applied
thought all forms where you can upload a file. The behavior like this is just because of a fact that Media Library is using
for all operations where you have an option for uploading a file.
